# Operational Risk Analytics â€“ Refund Fraud Detection (Amazon Simulation Sample) - 2022

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed operational risks related to fraudulent refund transactions for an e-commerce platform (Amazon simulation).  
Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I built a full-stack fraud detection solution to help business teams identify fraud trends, high-risk regions, and customer behaviors.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform SQL-based data modeling and enrichment
- Conduct fraud pattern analysis with Python
- Deliver business insights through a professional Power BI dashboard

---

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used
- `refund_transactions_sample_v2.csv` â€” Transactional refund data (500 records)
- `region_info.csv` â€” Region names and risk scores
- `customer_info.csv` â€” Customer segments (Regular / Premium)

These datasets were combined through SQL joins to create a unified analysis.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Calculate the total number of refunds and fraudulent refunds
- Identify regions with highest fraud risk
- Understand common reasons for fraudulent refunds
- Detect fraud trends over time (monthly)
- Build an interactive dashboard for business decision-makers

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Joins, aggregations, fraud rate calculation
- **Python**: Data exploration (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development with dark theme, KPIs, charts, tables

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Delivered
- Total Refunds
- Total Fraudulent Refunds
- Fraud Rate (%)
- Fraud Rate by Region
- Top 5 Refund Reasons
- Monthly Fraud Trends
- List of High-Risk (Fraudulent) Transactions

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
The final dashboard includes:
- KPI Cards displaying Total Refunds, Total Frauds, and Fraud Rate
- A Bar Chart showing Fraud Rate (%) by Region
- A Line Chart illustrating Monthly Fraud Trend
- A Bar Chart for Top 5 Refund Reasons
- A Table listing High-Risk Fraudulent Transactions

The dashboard adopts a **dark theme** for enhanced visual clarity.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Fraud rates are higher in regions classified as "High Risk" (East Coast, West Coast).
- Refund fraud incidents peak during holiday seasons (November - January).
- "Duplicate Orders" and "Item Not Received" are the top refund reasons exploited.
- Premium customers show slightly higher fraud rates compared to Regular customers.
